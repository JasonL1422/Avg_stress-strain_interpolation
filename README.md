# Avg_stress-strain_interpolation
* This Mathematica code is to average multiple stress-strain curves, which have difference X values. [Contact: jongcheol1422@gmail.com]
* Interpolation curves are generated, and values at every "step" are averaged.

* The code imports .xlsx file in directory 'Data'
* The code should be located in the same directory where 'Data' is located.
* The import file (.xlsx) has two sheets.
* One has multiple (three) stress-strain data in (X,Y) values (6 columns).
* The other (second) sheet has multiple (three) modulus-strain data in (X,Y) values (6 columns).
* The number of rows should be the same for each data. You can cut at a certain number.
* Note: The exemplat file (.xlsx in 'Data' folder) and the modulus average part are not provided.
